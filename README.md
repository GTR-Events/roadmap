# GTR Public Roadmap

This is GTR's official public roadmap. Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. 

## Guide to the Roadmap
Every item on the roadmap is a read-only issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

* A release phase that describes the current phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

* The product to which the item belongs. For a list of current products, see below.

* The area of focus that the roadmap item is associated with. A list of current areas of focus can be found below.

As issues become generally available to the public, they will be closed. A list of all current and closed issues can be found on the issues tab.

## Release Phases
Every product or feature goes through a set of release phases, from early testing to general availability.

* alpha: Primarily for testing and feedback
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change.

* beta: Publicly available in full or limited capacity
Features mostly complete and documented.

 * ga: Generally available to all customers
Ready for production use and fully documented.

## Roadmap Stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense of potential dates of completion. Columns are broken up by quarter, showing projections for the current quarter and next 3 quarters. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. Items on the furthest right column, called Future, have no current expected ship date and will be added/moved/removed from the board as needed.

## Disclaimer
Any statement in this repository that is not purely historical is considered a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements included in this repository are based on information available to GTR as of the date they are made, and GTR assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any product or feature, or to deliver any product and feature by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general development plans. Customers should not rely on this roadmap to make any purchasing decision.
